      <p> &emsp; A 2016 physician survey found that 21 percent of the doctor’s time goes to non-clinical paperwork.
        That means less time for the patient and more chance of burnout for the doctor.</p>
      <p> &emsp; Thanks to latest technologies, the vast majority of non-clinical work can be automated, giving 
        physicians more time to do what matters: practice medicine. In fact, according to a recent research report, 
        all healthcare providers will embrace these care delivery-optimization technologies in the next 3-5 years.</p>
